# multiBracketValidation

## Feature Tasks
* On your main file, create a function called `multiBracketValidation(input)`

Your function should take a string as its only argument, and should return a boolean representing whether or not the brackets in the string are balanced. There are 3 types of brackets:

* Round Brackets : `()`
* Square Brackets : `[]`
* Curly Brackets : `{}`

## Approach & Efficiency
As we visualized the problem domain, we knew we needed to loop through the string, somehow store all the opening brackets, then compare them with the closing bracketsâ€”starting with the **last** opening bracket stored. Because we needed to get each opening bracket using some sort of **LIFO** structure, we utilized a **Stack** in our algorithm.

* Because we're looping through the input string, our time efficiency is **O(n)**. 
* Because we're storing any opening brackets at the start of our input string in a stack, our space efficiency is **O(n)**.

### Note:
After taking the photo, we realized the Big O for space in this whiteboard is incorrect; the space efficiency for this algorithm is **O(n)**, as we're creating a stack of opening brackets whose size is dependent on the input.

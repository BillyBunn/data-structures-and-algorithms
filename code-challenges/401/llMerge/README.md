# Code Challenge: Class 08
Completed with Shannon Tully.

## Feature task
Challenge adds a methods to the LinkedList class:
* `mergeLists` - takes two linked lists as arguments. Zips the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list. Keeps additional space down to O(1).
